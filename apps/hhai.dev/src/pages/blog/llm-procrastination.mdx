- I've been procrastinating a lot recently, couldn't start working on my tasks
- LLM serves as a starting point (of course not perfect and that's the point)
and then I can continue working on it
- Sometimes there are hard problems need to be designed before implementation,
LLM can help sketch out the rough design and the possible aspects to consider




- Are human beings any different than animals?
- We look forward to welcome you
