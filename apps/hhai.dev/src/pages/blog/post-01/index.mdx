Markdown is really nice to work with, especially when you're a developer.  This
is why it has become the default language choice for document writing among
software engineers. Its design emphasizes readability in plain text, allowing
you to read and edit raw text without relying on a parser like
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert it into HTML or a renderer such as a
browser to view the formatted HTML.

The widespread adoption of Markdown really speaks for itself; it has become so
prevalent that its usage hardly needs any further explanation. The vast
ecosystem has almost everything I need through Remark and Rehype plugins. I have
even created custom plugins for this blog due to the ease and how
straightforward it is to modify the Markdown syntax tree.

This post demonstrates my customized Markdown-to-post process, serving as both
documentation and a guide for future reference, saving me from revisiting the
code to figure out what I implemented.

## Markdown, but more powerful

[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm) enhances standard
Markdown by incorporating additional features such as tables, task list items,
and autolinks, automatically converting plain text URLs into clickable links.
I'm so used to writing Markdown on GitHub I didn't even know these features are
extensions and not in the Markdown standard.  GFM is the default formatting in
[Astro](https://astro.build/), the framework I used for this site.

Beyond Markdown, it's MDX, a superset supporting embedded components from
various frameworks. This versatility ensures I'm well-equipped, especially when
creating interactive posts.

## Writing code

I'm a software developer, so I should expect code in my blog posts. And I want
them to be nicely syntax highlighted like in the IDEs too. I chose
[rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/), a wrapper of
[shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) for Markdown so I don't have to think
much about it.

Aside from syntax highlighting, it has some other nice features too. The inline
code can also be colored: `var x = 2{:go}`. With the code block, you can add
title, show line numbers or highlight specific lines or words.

```go showLineNumbers title="example.go" {5-6, 1} /Address/
package main

type Address struct {
	Street  string `json:"street"`
	Suite   string `json:"suite"`
	Zipcode string `json:"zipcode"`
}
```

`![sample diagram](diagram.png)` creates image with multiple sizes for different
screen resolutions. If the image path starts with `./`, it will be relative with
the `mdx` file. Otherwise, it will look for images inside the
`content/blog/images` directory.

```md /feature-sm/ /lg/
