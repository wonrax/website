import CodeGroup from '@/components/CodeGroup.tsx'

Congrats, you discovered my secret den for testing!

<CodeGroup client:load>

```rust title="file_01.rs"
fn main() {}
```
```rust title="file_02.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("hehe");
}
```

</CodeGroup>


```rust title="file_02.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("hehe");
}
```

:::warning
**Or will I?** This could very well be my last post. Ironically, what's the
purpose of all these efforts if I don't keep writing?

:::note
While I use Prisma schema for migration and development purposes, the backend
employs Rust [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) for handling SQL
queries. I'm not embedding an engine into the API just to do basic SQL
operations.
