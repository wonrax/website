- [ ] Update the system
- [ ] Use firewall:
	- If the cloud provider has a firewall, use it, if not, use `ufw`
	- Allow only the ports that are needed:
		- Allows port 22 for SSH **for a specific IP range** (e.g. home IP)
		- Allows port 80 and 443, 443/UDP (QUIC) for HTTP and HTTPS
		- Drops the rest
- [ ] SSH configuration:
	- 	Make sure to use RSA only authentication method and disable password.
		Remember to `service ssh restart` to reload the config.

		```sh
		# /etc/ssh/sshd_config

		PasswordAuthentication no
