Congrats, you discovered my secret den for testing!

<CodeGroup client:load>
```rust title="group_file_01.rs"
fn main() {}
```

```rust title="group_file_02.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("hehe");
}
```

</CodeGroup>

```rust title="file_02.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("hehe");
}
```

**Or will I?** This could very well be my last post. Ironically, what's the

:::note
While I use Prisma schema for migration and development purposes, the backend
employs Rust [diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel) for handling SQL
queries. I'm not embedding an engine into the API just to do basic SQL
operations.
