This is a sample photography collection demonstrating the new photography layout. You can write basic prose here to introduce your photo collection or tell a story.

## Portrait Gallery

Here's how you can display multiple portrait images side by side with horizontal scrolling:

<PortraitGallery
  images={[
    {
      src: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4?w=2400&h=3600&fit=crop",
      alt: "Sample portrait 1",
      caption: "Mountain landscape in portrait orientation",
      width: 2400,
      height: 3600,
    },
    {
      src: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1469474968028-56623f02e42e?w=2400&h=3600&fit=crop",
      alt: "Sample portrait 2",
      caption: "Forest scene in portrait orientation",
      width: 2400,
      height: 3600,
    },
    {
      src: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501594907352-04cda38ebc29?w=2400&h=3600&fit=crop",

    {
